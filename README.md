### 🏳️ Descripion and Comments 

I don't think we required big frameworks, like react, in this simple test.  if costs and maintenance are important concerns, the best solution I suggest is to create the page with  HTML, CSS, and Js if necessary.

After getting the assets I looked at what I needed to use in the template, and separate the assets. You talk about not thinking about integration with maps, even though that is easy, I use the PSD, to save new assets, creating with the specifications.

In the next steps, I just need to separate the fonts, and assets, and start thinking what the best way to construct the test.

To make some difference, I create a new selection from cities, to make a better user experience, and add form validators.

Another resolution I made, was the responsible version for mobile users with the rest of time.
